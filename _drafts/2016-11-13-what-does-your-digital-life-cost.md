Are you one of those people who hate paying for apps on your phone, even if they are only £0.79 (or $0.99 for the Americans)? I am; [And it really bugs me](http://theoatmeal.com/blog/apps). I'm constantly telling my wife to just buy app X which will make her life easier since it's only a pound, cheaper than almost any cup of coffee she might buy while out and about, and yet, I still don't want to buy whatever game, just in case it isn't absolutely amazing. However, when it comes to other aspects of my digital life, I don't hesitate to drop money on it. It's not like I don't have Netflix, and this blog has to be hosted somewhere. While I still don't understand why we hesitate to spend money on mobile apps, I got thinking about what I do spend money on for various apps and services. How much does my digital life cost me? 

I'm not a "normal" computer user. I'd definitely classify myself as a "power user", since the average person doesn't have a VPS, or know what a VPN is, so the total is going to be higher than average. Here are the services that I pay for (that I can remember at least) in no particular order:

| Service                                  | Monthly Fees[^4] |   Annual Fees   |
| ---------------------------------------- | :--------------: | :-------------: |
| [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com)       |      £7.49       |                 |
| [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=0527e2a40ef8) |  $5.00 (£3.97)   |                 |
| [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com) |                  | $36.95 (£29.33) |
| [Google Apps](https://goo.gl/EznijD) * 2[^1] |      £5.50       |                 |
| [Google Music](https://play.google.com/music)[^2] |      £9.99       |                 |
| [Backblaze](https://secure.backblaze.com/r/01eawr) |                  | $50.00 (£39.68) |
| Mobile Phone ([giffgaff](https://www.giffgaff.com/orders/affiliate/dalemyers)) |      £10.00      |                 |
| Amazon Prime / Amazon Video ([UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/prime)/[US](https://www.amazon.com/prime)) |                  |     £79.00      |
| Office 365[^3] - ([UK](https://products.office.com/en-gb/office-365-home)/[US](https://products.office.com/en-us/office-365-home)) |                  |     £79.99      |
| [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) |                  |     £79.00      |
| **Total**                                |    **£36.95**    |   **£307.00**   |



The sum of all of these across a year is **£750.40** (£62.53 a month). As it turns out, a digital life isn't that cheap. 

The real question though is "Is it worth it?". Absolutely. I'd never give up any of these services if I could possibly avoid it (unless a better alternative was shown to me). 

What would I pay more for? I'd probably pay somewhere up to 50% more for each of these in turn. However, with a few minor tweaks on these, I'd pay a lot more. Taking Netflix as an example, if it could show me the latest TV shows (basically a cord cutting service), even a few weeks, or even a month or two later, then I'd happily pay £30 a month. 

What I would like to know is whether or not this could be classified as a "cushy" digital life? I definitely spend more than the average user. What about the average developer out there though? Am I ahead, behind, somewhere in the middle?

[^1]: I have an account for my wife as well, but since she would quite happily use the free Gmail, I count this as something I pay. 
[^2]: I'd like to pay for YouTube Red, but it's not available in the UK. It's getting a little ridiculous at this point.
[^3]: As a Microsoft employee I actually pay less, but I'd pay the regular price if I didn't get this benefit. 
[^4]: Conversions from USD to GBP use a rate of 1 GBP = 1.26 USD.
