Despite moving into this flat 4 months ago, I still have a lot of work to do to
make it a home. Part of this has been making sure we have some nice decorations
on the walls to look at. The problem with being 25 is that you feel a little
childish putting posters up on the wall. The adult thing to do is to put them in
a frame and *then* put them on the wall. 

So far out of the 4 frames I've put up, I have 2 posters. Finding the final two
is proving to be tricky though. I wanted something I have a love of, that would
look pretty awesome on the wall. The solution came to me thanks to
[@CGPGrey](https://twitter.com/cgpgrey). One of his videos is on [transporter
technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQHBAdShgYI) and had some great
artwork by [Knut](http://kittyninjafish.deviantart.com/). The style was exactly
what I'm looking for, and I love Star Trek. 

Thanks to Knut, I've got a great poster I'm about to get printed so that I can
put it up on my wall. I'm wondering if I can get the Battlestar Galactica done
next...
