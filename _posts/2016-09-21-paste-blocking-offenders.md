Every so often I get blocked from logging into a website or mobile application because of "security". Apparently the ability to paste in a password is insecure. Why? I have no idea. I've literally never seen a single good reason to block pasting into the password field. Thankfully, 1Password gets around this when using their extension, but it's not always possible to use if I'm on a different machine. I could type the entire password, but that would just be annoying. Instead, I have to revert to editing the DOM using whatever inspector the browser provides. On mobile though, I don't get that luxury. When an app blocks me from pasting my password, I simply don't use that app. In cases where the app clears the typed password so far when I change apps, I _can't_ use it because I simply can't remember the entire password. 

The worst part about this though, is when I contact these companies asking for them to fix this behaviour and they tell me it's deliberate and for "security", but then can't or won't explain why. If you cannot tell people your security measures then you are relying on [security through obscurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity) and that is, rather ironically, not secure. 

When my bank tells me this same thing, I lose faith in my bank. I wonder if I should switch to a different bank that doesn't appear to rely on security through obscurity? Then I wonder about other people who are thinking about going with that bank and wonder if I should warn them? Probably. In that spirit, I'm going to try and keep a list of all the apps (and possibly websites, although I notice these much less frequently) that block pasting into password fields, starting with Bank of Scotland. If you have any that you have found that you would like added to the list, let me know: [pasteblockers@myers.io](mailto:pasteblockers@myers.io)
